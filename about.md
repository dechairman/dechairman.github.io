I am no expert at anything. At least not yet. I am a student of technology. 
I am a fan of technology and specifically Apple products. As such, I am interested in research areas that concern iOS and macOS
vulnerability research. From low level exploitation to userland. I also do indulge in web application security research too.
This blog serves first as motivation for me to document what I learn through this journey. Feel feel to learn or correct anything
you see on here.
