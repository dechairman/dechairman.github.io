I am no expert at anything. At least not yet. I am a student of technology. 
I am a fan of technology and specifically enterprise infrastructure security. As such, I am interested in research areas that concern OS internals, networking, platform security, application security etc.
This blog serves first as motivation for me to document what I learn through this journey. Feel free to learn or correct anything you see on here.
